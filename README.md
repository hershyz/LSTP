<p>
LSTP is a CLI utility built around a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron">perceptron</a> structure neural network.<br/>
The neuron and synapses are programmed differently than a traditional neural network, resulting in drastically shorter training runtimes.</br>
LSTP uses a regression algorithm combined with a proportional weight adjustment formula to make predictions during and after the training process.</br>
