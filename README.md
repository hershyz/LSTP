<p>
  LSTP is a CLI application wrapped around a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron">perceptron</a> neural network.<br/>
  Traditional perceptrons are binary classifiers, only being able to perform operations on 0 or 1 inputs and outputs.<br/>
  LSTP uses a training algorithm based on an intercept in infinite dimensions, allowing it to make predictions on non-binary data.<br/>
  Data does not have to be linearly separable for LSTP to make accurate predictions, unlike any other perceptron created.<br/>
  This is a general machine learning model, but works best with consistently  correlated, low variability data.<br/>
